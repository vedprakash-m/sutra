## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges
1. **Test Flakiness:** Implement proper mocking and async handling
2. **Performance Impact:** Use test parallelization and selective test runs
3. **Maintenance Overhead:** Focus on test quality and clear patterns
4. **Coverage Gaming:** Emphasize meaningful tests over coverage percentage

### Contingency Plans
1. **If Coverage Goals Not Met:** Prioritize critical path coverage first
2. **If Tests Become Flaky:** Implement retry mechanisms and better isolation
3. **If Performance Degrades:** Optimize test setup and use test sharding
4. **If Maintenance Burden High:** Invest in test utilities and documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (This Week):**
   - Run detailed analysis of failing backend tests
   - Create test fix plan with specific error resolutions
   - Set up test coverage monitoring dashboard

2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks):**
   - Fix all backend test failures
   - Add tests for highest-impact missing modules
   - Establish coverage baseline and targets

3. **Long Term (2+ Weeks):**
   - Execute full coverage improvement plan
   - Implement continuous coverage monitoring
   - Document testing best practices and patterns

4. **Final Step (After Achieving 70% Coverage):**
   - Reinstate the 70% test coverage requirement in CI/CD pipeline
   - Update CI/CD configuration to enforce coverage thresholds
   - Ensure all future code changes maintain >70% coverage

This plan provides a roadmap to systematically improve test coverage while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.
