## 6.4 Forge Stage Flexibility & Quality Assurance

**Quality-Preserving Flexibility Framework:**

**Required Stages (Quality Gates):**

- **Stage 1 (Idea Refinement):** Mandatory - ensures structured problem definition
- **Stage 2 (PRD Generation):** Mandatory - provides requirements foundation for all subsequent work

**Optional Stages (With Quality Impact Assessment & User Choice):**

- **Stage 3 (UX Requirements):**
  - **Skip Conditions:** API-only projects, technical tools, backend services, external UX team handling
  - **Quality Impact:** 15-25% reduction in implementation completeness for user-facing features
  - **User Compensation Options:** When skipping, users choose from multiple compensation approaches:
    - **comprehensive_ux_prompts:** Include detailed UI/UX guidance in implementation playbook
    - **basic_ux_prompts:** Cover essential user interactions and error handling
    - **ux_research_tasks:** Generate actionable tasks for external UX team
    - **no_compensation:** Skip entirely for pure backend/API projects
  - **Quality Metrics:** Each compensation option includes estimated quality impact and additional token cost

**Conditional Stage Logic:**

```python
class ForgeStageManager:
    def assess_stage_requirements(self, project_type, team_composition):
        """Intelligently determine required stages based on project context"""

        required_stages = ["idea_refinement", "prd_generation", "implementation_playbook"]
        optional_stages = []

        # UX Requirements Logic
        if project_type in ["web_app", "mobile_app", "saas_platform"]:
            required_stages.append("ux_requirements")
        elif team_composition.get("has_ux_designer"):
            optional_stages.append("ux_requirements")  # Team can handle externally

        # Technical Analysis is always beneficial but varies in depth
        required_stages.append("technical_analysis")

        return {
            "required": required_stages,
            "optional": optional_stages,
            "quality_impact": self.calculate_quality_impact(optional_stages)
        }
```

**Template-Based Acceleration (No Quality Loss):**

```python
class ForgeTemplateSystem:
    def get_project_templates(self):
        return {
            "web_app_mvp": {
                "stages": ["idea", "prd", "ux", "tech", "playbook"],
                "pre_filled_data": {
                    "tech_stack_options": ["React+Node", "Next.js+Supabase"],
                    "deployment_patterns": ["Vercel", "AWS Amplify"],
                    "ux_patterns": ["Dashboard", "Authentication", "CRUD"]
                }
            },
            "api_service": {
                "stages": ["idea", "prd", "tech", "playbook"],  # Skip UX
                "pre_filled_data": {
                    "tech_stack_options": ["FastAPI+PostgreSQL", "Express+MongoDB"],
                    "api_patterns": ["REST", "GraphQL"],
                    "testing_strategies": ["Unit+Integration", "Contract Testing"]
                }
            },
            "mobile_app": {
                "stages": ["idea", "prd", "ux", "tech", "playbook"],
                "pre_filled_data": {
                    "tech_stack_options": ["React Native", "Flutter"],
                    "ux_patterns": ["Tab Navigation", "Stack Navigation"],
                    "deployment": ["App Store", "Play Store", "TestFlight"]
                }
            }
        }
```

**Quality Validation at Each Stage:**

- **Completeness Scoring:** AI-powered assessment of stage output quality (0-100%)
- **Dependency Validation:** Ensure each stage has sufficient input from previous stages
- **Output Standards:** Minimum thresholds for proceeding to next stage
- **Template Enhancement:** Use successful project patterns to improve templates

**Security Considerations:**

- All Forge operations require Microsoft Entra ID authentication
- Project data is isolated by user/team boundaries
- Sensitive operations (LLM changes, budget overrides) require elevated permissions
