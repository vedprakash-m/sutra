## 4. Prioritized Feature Set & User Journeys (MVP & Beyond)

This section details Sutra's features, prioritized by their estimated ROI (Return on Investment) and cross-role usefulness, making the MVP clear and setting a roadmap for future enhancements.

### 4.1. Core Prompt Creation & Multi-LLM Optimization (Phase 1 / MVP)

**Purpose:** Enable users to efficiently craft, test, and compare prompts across various LLMs to achieve optimal output. This is fundamental for all roles.

**User Journey: Guided Prompt Creation & Multi-LLM Comparison**

- User navigates to "Prompt Builder" or clicks "New Prompt."
- System presents a guided interface for prompt creation.
- User inputs Intention (e.g., "Write a marketing email," "Generate Python function," "Summarize customer feedback").
- System prompts for Contextual Details (e.g., target audience, tone, length, key points, examples) using structured fields.
- Users can also define custom input variables (e.g., `{{product_name}}`, `{{customer_query}}`, `{{error_log}}`) directly within the prompt text. These variables automatically generate corresponding input fields in the UI for easy data injection.
- **Prompt Text Area:** This is the editable primary prompt area. Changes in structured fields reflect here, and direct edits update structured fields where possible. Supports dynamic variable insertion.
- User selects Target LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, specific custom endpoints).
- User clicks "Generate & Compare."
- System displays outputs from selected LLMs side-by-side.
- User reviews outputs, provides Feedback (thumbs up/down, short comment).
- An initial LLM-based output evaluation/scoring provides quick qualitative feedback (e.g., "Good adherence to tone," "Syntactically Correct Code," "Meets Document Structure").
- User can iteratively refine the prompt based on results and "PromptCoach" suggestions, or Save the prompt to a collection.

**UI Elements:**

- **Left Panel (Prompt Input & Guidance):** "Intention" field, Dynamic "Contextual Details" (dropdowns, multi-selects, sliders), Editable "Prompt Text Area" (supporting `{{variables}}`), "PromptCoach" widget, LLM selection.
- **Right Panel (Output & Comparison):** Tabbed/side-by-side LLM outputs, Qualitative Output Evaluation/Score, Feedback buttons, "Copy Output" and "Download Output" buttons (with format options like Plain Text, Markdown, JSON, Code Language-specific).

**System Behavior:**

- "PromptCoach" provides dynamic suggestions.
- Parallel calls to selected LLM APIs.
- Outputs are clearly labeled.
- Saving records version, LLMs, and feedback.
