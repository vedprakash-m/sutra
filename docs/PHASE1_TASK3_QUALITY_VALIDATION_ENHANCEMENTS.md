    "detected_gaps": [
        {
            "stage": "idea_refinement",
            "missing_context_keys": ["problemStatement", "valueProposition"],

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Quality Assessment Engine Integration

The quality validator works seamlessly with the existing `QualityAssessmentEngine`:
- Uses quality metrics from each stage for validation
- Validates quality thresholds (75%→80%→82%→85%)
- Provides context for quality improvement suggestions

### 2. Forge API Integration

Quality validators are used in all Forge endpoints:
- `validate_stage_readiness()` - Before allowing stage progression
- `validate_cross_stage_consistency()` - During stage transitions
- `detect_context_gaps()` - In compilation and review endpoints
- `generate_ai_improvement_suggestions()` - For quality enhancement features

### 3. Implementation Playbook Integration

Quality validation ensures playbook generation has:
- Complete context from all stages
- No high-severity gaps
- Consistent data across all stages
- Quality scores meeting minimum thresholds

---

## API Usage Examples

### Example 1: Validate Stage Readiness

```python
validator = CrossStageQualityValidator()
result = validator.validate_stage_readiness(
    target_stage="technical_analysis",
    project_data=project_data
)

if result.is_consistent:
    # Safe to proceed to technical analysis
    print(f"Ready! Consistency score: {result.consistency_score:.1%}")
else:
    # Handle validation errors
    print(f"Errors: {result.validation_errors}")
    print(f"Recommendations: {result.recommendations}")
```

### Example 2: Detect Context Gaps

```python
gaps_analysis = validator.detect_context_gaps(project_data)

print(f"Completeness Score: {gaps_analysis['completeness_score']:.1f}%")
print(f"High-Severity Gaps: {gaps_analysis['high_severity_gaps']}")

for suggestion in gaps_analysis['remediation_suggestions']:
    print(f"\nStage: {suggestion['stage']}")
    print(f"Missing: {suggestion['missing_field']}")
    print(f"Action: {suggestion['action']}")
    print(f"Guidance: {suggestion['guidance']}")
    print(f"Example: {suggestion['example']}")
```

### Example 3: Generate AI Improvement Suggestions

```python
improvements = validator.generate_ai_improvement_suggestions(
    project_data=project_data,
    target_stage="idea_refinement"
)

print(f"Total Suggestions: {improvements['total_suggestions']}")
print(f"High Priority: {improvements['high_priority_count']}")
print(f"Potential Improvement: {improvements['estimated_total_improvement']}")

for phase in improvements['recommended_action_plan']:
    print(f"\n{phase['phase']} ({phase['duration']})")
    for item in phase['items']:
        print(f"  - {item}")
```

### Example 4: Validate Cross-Stage Consistency

```python
consistency = validator.validate_cross_stage_consistency(
    source_stage="idea_refinement",
    target_stage="prd_generation",
    project_data=project_data
)

if consistency.is_consistent:
    print(f"Excellent! Consistency: {consistency.consistency_score:.1%}")
else:
    print("Consistency Issues Found:")
    for error in consistency.validation_errors:
        print(f"  - {error}")
    print("\nRecommendations:")
    for rec in consistency.recommendations:
        print(f"  - {rec}")
```
