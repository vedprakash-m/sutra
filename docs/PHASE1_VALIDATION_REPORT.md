## Technical Debt

### Non-Blocking Issues

#### 1. Implementation Playbook Endpoints

**File:** `api/forge_api/implementation_playbook_endpoints.py`
**Issue:** References undefined classes (QualityEngine, CodingAgentOptimizer, LLMClient)
**Impact:** Module cannot be imported, but doesn't affect core platform
**Priority:** Medium
**Timeline:** Address during Phase 2 in parallel with deployment
**Resolution:** Replace undefined classes with actual implementations or remove placeholder code

#### 2. End-to-End Test Mocking

**File:** `api/test_forge_e2e.py`
**Issue:** Attempts to mock non-existent functions in Azure Function modules
**Impact:** 8 test failures (test framework issue, not implementation bugs)
**Priority:** Low
**Timeline:** Fix during Phase 2 to improve test coverage
**Resolution:** Update tests to properly mock Azure Function context and dependencies
