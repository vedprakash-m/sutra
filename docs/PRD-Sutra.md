### 6.1. **Intelligent Prompt Engineering & Optimization (Phase 1 / MVP)**

**Purpose:** Enable users to efficiently craft, test, and compare prompts across various LLMs to achieve optimal output. This is fundamental for all roles.

#### **User Journey: Guided Prompt Creation & Multi-LLM Comparison**

1. User navigates to "Prompt Builder" or clicks "New Prompt."
2. System presents a guided interface for prompt creation.
3. User inputs Intention (e.g., "Write a marketing email," "Generate Python function," "Summarize customer feedback").
4. System prompts for Contextual Details (e.g., target audience, tone, length, key points, examples) using structured fields.
5. Users can also define custom input variables (e.g., `{{product_name}}`, `{{customer_query}}`, `{{error_log}}`) directly within the prompt text. These variables automatically generate corresponding input fields in the UI for easy data injection.
6. **Prompt Text Area:** This is the editable primary prompt area. Changes in structured fields reflect here, and direct edits update structured fields where possible. Supports dynamic variable insertion.
7. User selects Target LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, specific custom endpoints).
8. User clicks "Generate & Compare."
9. System displays outputs from selected LLMs side-by-side.
10. User reviews outputs, provides Feedback (thumbs up/down, short comment).
11. An initial LLM-based output evaluation/scoring provides quick qualitative feedback (e.g., "Good adherence to tone," "Syntactically Correct Code," "Meets Document Structure").
12. User can iteratively refine the prompt based on results and "PromptCoach" suggestions, or Save the prompt to a collection.

#### **UI Elements:**

- **Left Panel (Prompt Input & Guidance):** "Intention" field, Dynamic "Contextual Details" (dropdowns, multi-selects, sliders), Editable "Prompt Text Area" (supporting `{{variables}}`), "PromptCoach" widget, LLM selection.
- **Right Panel (Output & Comparison):** Tabbed/side-by-side LLM outputs, Qualitative Output Evaluation/Score, Feedback buttons, "Copy Output" and "Download Output" buttons (with format options like Plain Text, Markdown, JSON, Code Language-specific).

#### **System Behavior:**

- "PromptCoach" provides dynamic suggestions.
- Parallel calls to selected LLM APIs.
- Outputs are clearly labeled.
- Saving records version, LLMs, and feedback.

#### **Wireframe: Prompt Builder**
