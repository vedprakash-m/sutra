## üéØ Quality Measurement Strategy

### **Revolutionary Quality System Architecture**

**Adaptive Quality Gates:** Context-aware quality thresholds that ensure each Forge stage builds on excellent foundations while adapting to project complexity and user experience level.

#### **Quality Threshold Progression**
```
Stage 1: Idea Refinement     ‚Üí 75% minimum (85% recommended)
Stage 2: PRD Generation      ‚Üí 80% minimum (90% recommended) 
Stage 3: UX Requirements     ‚Üí 82% minimum (90% recommended)
Stage 4: Technical Analysis  ‚Üí 85% minimum (92% recommended)
```

#### **Context-Aware Adjustments**
