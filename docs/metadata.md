## 📈 **Implementation Progress Tracking**

### **Daily Progress Updates**

**2025-01-27 - CRITICAL CI/CD FIX COMPLETED**

- ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed 2 failing Prompts API tests in CI/CD
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Authentication vs validation order - tests expected 400 but got 401
- ✅ **Solution**: Enhanced authentication mocking with comprehensive @patch decorators
- ✅ **Local Validation Enhanced**: Added authentication mocking validation to prevent future issues
- ✅ **All Tests Passing**: 325/325 backend tests now pass with 86% coverage
- ✅ **Prompts API Coverage**: Maintained 79% coverage (exceeded 75% target)
- 🔄 **NEXT**: Continue with Phase 1 implementation plan

**Authentication Mocking Pattern Established:**

```python
@patch("api.shared.auth.AuthManager.kv_client", new_callable=PropertyMock)
@patch("api.shared.auth.AuthManager.get_auth_config")
@patch("api.shared.auth.AuthManager.validate_token")
@patch("api.shared.auth.AuthManager.get_user_from_token")
@patch("api.shared.auth.AuthManager.check_permission")
@patch("api.prompts.get_database_manager")
```

**Local Validation Gap Analysis Results:**

- **Issue Pattern**: Tests expecting early validation (400) need comprehensive auth mocking
- **Prevention**: Enhanced local validation now checks for auth mocking patterns
- **CI/CD Alignment**: Local environment now better matches CI/CD authentication flow
